# airflow_learning
Repository contains code and details about airflow concepts

This repository has been created to learn, code and deep dive to Airflow concepts, its uses and functioning, to enable effective and best way to use the Airflow with Python.

How much python is required for Apache Airflow ?
  This question often comes in mind of an individual, or a person who just started to learn, how much python they required to learn and start writing airflow dags ?
  For startup, we just need fundamental understanding of Python :
  1. Basic Python syntax
       Variables
       Datatypes
       functions
       loops
       conditionals
       Data Structure [list, tuple, string, set, dictonary]

  2.  Modules and Libraries
        How to import and use various modules and libraries in Python ?

  3.  Function and Classes
         Airflow task are often written as Python functions, so you need to know
            How to define function and use functions ?
            Familarity with OOPS programming in Python

  4. File Handling
       Reading & writing files

  5.  Error Handling
        How to handle exceptions in Python ?

  6.  Airflow uses Jinja Templating, so basic templating knowledge can be helpful.

Before we start designing the airflow dags, lets first understand, 
  What is Airflow ? 
  What's before Airflow ?
  What is the use of Airflow ?
  Applications of Airflow ?
  Advantages and Disadvantages of Airflow ?
  Alternative of Airflow ?

Airflow : [Apache Airflow]
  Airflow is a open-source tool to programatically author, monitor and schedule **workflows**.
  It is robust platform used by Data engineers to orchastrate workflows or data piplines. 
  One can easily visulaize data pipline's:
    Dependency, Proggress, Logs, Errors, Code, Success and Failed status.

  From above defination, one question arieses ? What is the workflow, data pipline and orchestrationand? what its significance in Airflow ?

  Workflow : Its a system to manager repetative processes and task which occur in a partiular order. 
  In other words, It is a set of tasks and steps which can be scheduled, intiated, and monitored. 
  Workflows are used to process, build application and process data.

  Here are some benefits of using workflows in cloud computing: 
  
  ** Reduced errors:** Manual steps can lead to errors, which can be costly and slow down business processes. 
                       Workflow automation can help reduce errors and make systems more efficient. 
  
  **Improved collaboration:** Workflows can help solve communication issues and improve collaboration. 
 
  **Reduced redundancies:** Workflows can help reduce redundancies in steps and human error. 
 
  **Increased business compliance:** Workflows can help support business compliance. 
 
  **Lowered costs:** Workflows can help lower costs by guiding information and task flow more efficiently. 
 
  **Increased focus:** Workflows can help employees focus on higher-value work

# airflow_learning
Repository contains code and details about airflow concepts

This repository has been created to learn, code and deep dive to Airflow concepts, its uses and functioning, to enable effective and best way to use the Airflow with Python.

How much python is required for Apache Airflow ?
  This question often comes in mind of an individual, or a person who just started to learn, how much python they required to learn and start writing airflow dags ?
  For startup, we just need fundamental understanding of Python :
  1. Basic Python syntax
       Variables
       Datatypes
       functions
       loops
       conditionals
       Data Structure [list, tuple, string, set, dictonary]

  2.  Modules and Libraries
        How to import and use various modules and libraries in Python ?

  3.  Function and Classes
         Airflow task are often written as Python functions, so you need to know
            How to define function and use functions ?
            Familarity with OOPS programming in Python

  4. File Handling
       Reading & writing files

  5.  Error Handling
        How to handle exceptions in Python ?

  6.  Airflow uses Jinja Templating, so basic templating knowledge can be helpful.

Before we start designing the airflow dags, lets first understand, 
  What is Airflow ? 
  What's before Airflow ?
  What is the use of Airflow ?
  Applications of Airflow ?
  Advantages and Disadvantages of Airflow ?
  Alternative of Airflow ?

Airflow : [Apache Airflow]
  Airflow is a open-source tool to programatically author, monitor and schedule **workflows**.
  It is robust platform used by Data engineers to orchastrate workflows or data piplines. 
  One can easily visulaize data pipline's:
    Dependency, Proggress, Logs, Errors, Code, Success and Failed status.

  From above defination, one question arieses, Workflow ? What is the workflow and what its significance in Airflow ?
